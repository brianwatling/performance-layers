# Vulkan Performance Layers

This project contains two Vulkan layers:
1. Compile-time layer for measuring pipeline compilation times.
2. Runtime layer for measuring pipeline execution times.
3. Frame time layer for measuring time between calls to vkQueuePresentKHR, in nanoseconds.

The results are saved as CSV files.

The layers are considered experimental.
We welcome contributions and suggestions for improvements; see [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md).
